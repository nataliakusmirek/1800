<h1>**1800 : A Text Based Adventure Game**</h1>

This project was created as an assignment in my AP Computer Science Principles course. The program, created in Python v3, allows for a user to make choices between two doors throughout the game based on description. The main idea is that you are trying to "steal the Declaration of Independence" just as Thomas Jefferson is elected President of the United States, without being caught. Their choices change the outcome of the game: advancement, loss of health, death, etc.

**Main features:**
* User starts with 3 lives, and once they lose all three it is game over
* User inputs their name and age, which are used in the game itself
* Practice of procedural abstraction and data abstraction
* Practice of writing neat, organized code
