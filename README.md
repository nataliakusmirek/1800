#1800 : A Text Based Adventure Game#

This project was created as an assignment in my AP Computer Science Principles course. The program, created in Python v3, allows for a user to make a choice between two doors based on description. Their choices change the outcome of the game: advancement, loss of health, death, etc.

Main features:
* User starts with 3 lives, and once they lose all three it is game over
* User inputs their name and age, which are used in the game itself
* Practice of procedural abstraction and data abstraction
* Practice of writing neat, organized code
